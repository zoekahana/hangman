# hangman

This repository includes a .txt file containing ~25,000 English words and the actual game file.

The game can be played through your command prompt. The program will select a word at random and your progress will appear after every turn. See the example below:

Your progress :: _i__u_ ("github" with 'i' and 'u' guessed)

The game is set up with 10 strikes, but this can be altered by changing the value of self.chances in the script.

Happy playing!
