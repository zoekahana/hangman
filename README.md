# hangman

This repository includes a .txt file containing ~25,000 English words and two game files: one that you can play in your command prompt, and one that includes graphics.

For the game you can play in your command prompt (hangman.py), the word will appear as dashes with letters filled in as you guess. See below:

Your progress :: \_i__u\_ ("github" with 'i' and 'u' guessed)

The game is set up with 10 strikes, but this can be altered by changing the value of self.chances in the script.

For the version with graphics (hangman_graphics.py), there are only 9 chances, each corresponding to one of 9 body parts I included in the script. 

Happy playing!
